### How was the weapon created?

The weapon was originally created in the United States of America, by Hiram S. Maxim in 1884. The machine gun was self powered and relied on energy released from the firing cartridges that then dislodged multiple bullets with just a pull of a trigger. It had a water cooled jacket around the barrel which allowed it to cool faster, and weighed roughly 136.5 pounds.

### What battle(s) was the weapon first used in? 

The Machine gun was first used in 1887 by the German armies. The German version of the machine gun was called the Spandau. During the battle of Somme, the British rushed German trenches and lost roughly 21,000 men, majority due to the Spandau machine guns.

### How did the weapon change the nature of war? Is this weapon (or a version of it) still used today? 

Machine guns changed warfare significantly, by changing war tactics used by countries. Warfare is always evolving, nothing will stay the same forever. Machine gun designs are always changing lighter and more accurate yearly. In 2015, the CT LMG was brought to introduction which only weighed 14.5 pounds. Compared to the WW1 machine guns this is significantly less.
