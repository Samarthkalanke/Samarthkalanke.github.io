### How was the weapon created?

The Submarine was created in the late 1500s by Dutch inventor Cornelius Drebbel. It was propelled by 8 oars sealed through the sides with leather flaps. 

### What battle(s) was the weapon first used in? 

The submarine was majorly used in World War I by Germany in order to attack other vessels in the ocean. The first battle that the submarine was used for was during the American revolution, where the U.S attempted to set a time bomb to a British admirals flagship in new York Harbor. 

### How did the weapon change the nature of war? Is this weapon (or a version of it) still used today? 

The weapon changed the nature of war because it provided more opportunity in sea to attack other vessels. Submarines were also used for other humanitarian efforts such as recovering vessels that have already sunk.
