The Weapons that were made during World War I were more efficient and better than the weapons that were used before World War I. For example, the guns had to be loaded more often and they couldn't fire far away. There was a lot of hand to hand combat and cannons were heavy and hard to move. The Shells were not as effective as they were in World War I and there was no use of airborne or chemical weapons. The Weapons used in World War I were way better and also created new strategies of battle as well. So many new kinds of weapons were used and made during World War I. These weaponschanged modern warfare becuase it introduce new and more gruesome weapons to be used in war like the introduction of war planes and poison gas. These weapons also became more efficient so they could take out more men in a shorter period of time making them all the more dangerous.
